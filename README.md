# Comparison-Between-Linear-and-Ridge-Regression-to-Predict-Brain-Connectivity

This paper contains details of the project developed to predict the evolution of connectivity between brain cells over time. To solve this problem, we made 2 regression models, compared the results, and determined the model that fits the data better. In the rest of the paper, the way in which the data is processed, which methods are used, what results are obtained from the project and comparison between linear and ridge regression for this problem will be shared.
